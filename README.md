## 🏠 Project Overview

SaleSphere is a comprehensive property rental web application designed to connect tenants with landlords in a seamless and secure manner. Developed as a university-level project using Java Servlets, JSP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with Tailwind CSS), it facilitates property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments for urban housing needs.

The system supports multiple user roles — Tenants (Users), Landlords (Admins), and System Admins — each with dedicated dashboards and functionalities. Tenants can browse properties, book rentals, leave reviews, and manage profiles. Landlords can list properties, manage bookings, and handle tenant interactions. System Admins oversee users, properties, and system-wide operations.

With its modular MVC architecture and fully responsive design, RentSphere provides a scalable solution for property rental management, emphasizing user experience and data security.

## 🧱 System Architecture

The architecture of RentSphere follows a modular MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of scalability.

### 🔹 1. Presentation Layer (View)
- Built using JSP, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
- Provides role-specific dashboards for Tenants, Landlords, and Admins.
- Displays properties, bookings, reviews, and forms with real-time updates.

### 🔹 2. Controller Layer
- Implemented using Java Servlets.
- Handles HTTP requests, routes to services, and manages sessions.
- Validates inputs and forwards to appropriate views.

### 🔹 3. Service Layer
- Java classes containing business logic for bookings, reviews, payments, etc.
- Interacts with database utilities.

### 🔹 4. Data Access Layer
- Manages MySQL connections via JDBC.
- Executes CRUD operations on tables like `users`, `admins`, `properties`, `bookings`, `reviews`, `PaymentCards`.

### 🔹 5. Database Layer
- MySQL with tables: `users` (tenants), `admins` (landlords/admins), `properties`, `bookings`, `reviews`, `PaymentCards`.
- Views for simplified queries: `bookings_view`, `reviews_view`, `properties_view`.
- Ensures data integrity with foreign keys and constraints.

This architecture ensures:
- 🔐 Security through session management and hashed passwords.
- ⚡ Performance with efficient queries and caching where applicable.
- 📦 Modularity for extensions (e.g., API integration, mobile views).

## 📱 Fully Responsive Design

SaleSphere is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS, ensuring seamless responsiveness across all screen sizes — from smartphones and tablets to large desktop monitors.

- Layouts adapt automatically using Tailwind's responsive utility classes.
- Pages scale and reflow for optimal viewing on small and large devices.
- Forms, dashboards, tables, and navigation are fully optimized for touch and mouse interaction.

🔍 The design has been tested on:
- Android and iOS devices
- Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- Desktop resolutions (1366px+, 1920px+)
- Common breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)

This ensures that users — whether tenants or landlords — enjoy a smooth and intuitive experience on any device.
